WORKING WITH OTHERS 

1) when starting up for day do 'git pull origin main '  --master for older  -- to keep files locally up to date with the remote main repo  just in case any other developers have made any changes

2) DO NOT MERGE BRANCH INTO MAIN BRANCH LOCALLY AND PUSH it will then change the main branch remotely 
   !! PUSH THE BRANCH UP TO THE REMOTE INSTEAD ! -  'git push origin feature-3 (the branch)`
