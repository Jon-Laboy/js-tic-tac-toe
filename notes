WORKING WITH OTHERS 

1) when starting up for day do 'git pull origin main '  --master for older  -- to keep files locally up to date with the remote main repo  just in case any other developers have made any changes

2) DO NOT MERGE BRANCH INTO MAIN BRANCH LOCALLY AND PUSH it will then change the main branch remotely 
   !! PUSH THE BRANCH UP TO THE REMOTE INSTEAD ! -  'git push origin feature-3 (the branch)`

3.) THEN CREATE PULL REQUEST by clicking compare & pull request
    - leave note about what did ..people can view and leave comments and managers / devs can be assigned as reviewers  

4.) later one someone says hey you missed something or need to update something from something you pushed and had merged --- before you start make sure to `git pull origin main` by going to main branch and doing that pull to make sure you are up to date.

 -- like hey missing notes --create new branch to handle this update since the old one was merged (like note-update or image-update branches)

 --push that new branch to the branch remotely and make a pull request. 
    --if then they leave a comment saying hey add this or this is missing and do it before merging then stay on that same branch fix and push again .. no need to make a new branch since it has not been merged yet..
